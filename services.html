            <h3>About cloud</h3>
            <a>
            <p class="arrow">Read this:</p>
            <p class="arrow">In AWS cloud  has over 200 fully featured services </p>
            <p class="arrow">Here we see some of the important services that are used now-a-days in industries.</p>
        <h3>Types of Services in AWS</h3>   
        <li><a href="#S3">S3</a></li>
        <li><a href="#EC2">EC2</a></li>
        <li><a href="#RDS">RDS</a></li>

        <P>Amazon Aurora,Amazon Route 53 (DNS),Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service),Amazon DynamoDB,Redshift, Aurora,Amazon Lex.</P>
        <section id="S3">
            <div class="about-content">
                <h2>S3(Simple Storage Service)</h2>
                <p>S3:Amazon S3 is an object storage service, which means it allows you to store and retrieve data as objects. Objects can include data files, images, videos, documents, and more. Each object is stored in a container called a "bucket."</p>
                <section id="EC2"></section>
                <h3>EC2(Eleastic Cloud Computing)</h3>
                <p>Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) is a web service that provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud, allowing users to run virtual servers (instances) for various computing workloads.</p>
                <p>EC2 allows businesses to run applications on the public cloud. An EC2 instance is a virtual server. Developers can use EC2 to build applications with great scalability.</p>
               <h4>Creating of EC2 Process</h4>
               <p>To create an application using resources stored on S3, you'll need to create an EC2 instance. You can use an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) to create a new instance. An AMI is a template that is used to create a new instance.</p>
           <h3>VPC(Virtual Private Network)</h3>
           <p>Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) is a virtual network in the AWS cloud that you can use to launch AWS resources. It's a foundational AWS service, which means that other AWS services, like Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), can't be accessed without a VPC network.</p>
           <p>You can specify an IP address range for the VPC, add subnets, add gateways, and associate security groups. You can access resources and applications through IPv4 or IPv6.</p>

         <h3>Lambda</h3>
         <p>AWS Lambda is a serverless computing service from Amazon Web Services (AWS). It allows users to run code for applications or backend services without provisioning or managing servers.</p>
        <p>AWS Lambda executes code in response to events in AWS services, such as adding or removing files in an S3 bucket, updating Amazon DynamoDB tables, or HTTP requests from Amazon API Gateway.</p>
        <h3>SNS(Simple Notification Service)</h3>
        <p>Amazon Web Services Simple Notification Service (AWS SNS) is a cloud service that sends push messages from applications to subscribers. SNS is a fully managed messaging service that supports both application-to-application (A2A) and application-to-person (A2P) communication. It can send messages through email, SMS, and application notifications.</p>
        <p>SNS is a push-based messaging service, which means that a publisher sends a message to a subscriber immediately instead of storing the message. SNS stores all messages across multiple availability zones to prevent loss.</p>
        <h3>SQS(Simple queue Service) </h3>
        <p>SQS stands for Simple Queue Service. It is a web service from Amazon that provides access to a message queue. SQS is a high-performance service that offers queues to support message transactions between applications or among the components of an application</p>
        <p>Amazon SQS is a web service that gives you access to a message queue that can be used to store messages while waiting for a computer to process them.</p>
        <p>FIFO Queues (First-In-First-Out)</p>
        <h3>Kinesis</h3>
        <p>Kinesis is a platform on AWS that sends your streaming data. It makes it easy to analyze load streaming data and also provides the ability for you to build custom applications based on your business needs.</p>
        <section id="RDS"></section>
        <h3>RDS(Relational Database Services)</h3>
        <p>Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS) is a web service that helps you set up, operate, and scale relational databases in the AWS Cloud. </p>
        <h4>RDS supports six database engines:</h4>
        <P>Amazon Aurora: It is a MySQL-Compatible relational database with five times performance.</P>
         <p>  Amazon DynamoDB: It is a fast and flexible NoSQL database service.</p> 
         <p> Amazon Redshift: It is a petabyte-scale data warehouse service.</p> 
         <p> Amazon Elasticache: It is an in-memory cache service with support for Memcached and Redis.</p> 
         <p> AWS Database Migration Service: It is a service that provides easy and inexpensive to migrate your databases to AWS cloud.</P>
         <h3>API(Application Programer interface)</h3>
        <p>Amazon API Gateway is a service from AWS that helps developers create, publish, maintain, monitor, and secure APIs.</p>
        <P>API Gateway can be used to create REST, HTTP, and WebSocket APIs. API Gateway can be used to create APIs that access AWS or other web services, as well as data stored in the AWS Cloud.</P>
